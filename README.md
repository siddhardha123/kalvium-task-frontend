# Attendance Page Task Submission

## Features of the Attendance Page

The Attendance Page is designed to track and capture student attendance. It offers the following features:

1. **Attendance Tracking**: The page allows students to mark their attendance for each class session. It captures the following information for each attendance record:
   - Date and time of attendance
   - Latitude and Longitude coordinates (for location verification)
   - IP Address (for additional verification)

2. **Attendance Percentage Calculation**: The page automatically calculates the attendance percentage for each student based on the total number of classes held and the number of classes attended.

3. **Margin and Due Calculation**: The system calculates two important metrics:
   - **Margin**: This indicates the number of classes a student can miss without facing consequences. For example, if the margin is set to 3 classes, a student can miss up to 3 classes without worrying about detention.
   - **Due**: This indicates the number of classes a student needs to attend to fulfill the attendance requirements. Falling below this number might result in failing to pass the semester.

4. **Visual Representation**: The attendance percentage, margin, and due are visually represented for each student, providing a clear overview of their attendance status.
